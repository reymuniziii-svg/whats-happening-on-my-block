What’s Happening on My Block? is a public NYC “block brief” tool that turns one address into a fast, shareable snapshot of nearby construction, street disruptions, collisions, 311 trends, sanitation frequencies, events, and film permits. It prioritizes immediate usefulness with plain-language summaries and module-level ranking logic designed for ten-second comprehension. Every card shows source links and methodology so users can verify where the data came from and how the result was computed.
